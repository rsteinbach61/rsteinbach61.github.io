I just finished my CLI Data Gem project. I struggled most with finding the right selectors to use to scrape the content I wanted. 

The best trick I learned was to open up Dev Tools, find the element I wanted to scrape, right click, hover over *copy* in the menu, and then pick *Copy selector*.  This helped me find the right selector to use in my scraping statements.

Along the way I also discovered and used Bundler to set up the CLI. This made it pretty simple to get the file structure right.
