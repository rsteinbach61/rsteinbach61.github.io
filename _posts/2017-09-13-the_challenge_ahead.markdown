Many folks come to Flat Iron to make a big change. I’m one of them. I won’t bore you with the details of my professional life and the reasons I’m looking for a change. We all have good reasons to commit our time and effort to change. Instead I’d like to tell you a true story about another change in my life. 

On Christmas Eve we took Ginger Pi, our thirteen-year-old dog, to see a cancer specialist. The prognosis was not good. The vet’s efforts gave us a wonderful last winter playing with Pi in an epic California snow year (she loved snow), but in the spring we had to let her go.

So, now we faced the huge question: “Do we get another dog?” Everyone had an opinion, but we miss Pi. She can’t be replaced!

Still we put out feelers to local dog rescues, and yesterday I got an email from one telling me that they had a puppy who needs help.  She came to the rescue in critical condition with a potentially fatal virus. They stabilized her, but she was still contagious so they couldn’t keep her in their shelter.

Now we had a big decision to make, and make quickly. We had a great dog… Can’t possibly repeat… I’m not sure we can do it again…

Well, yes, we took her in. We’re on day one. We’re scared. We’re excited. 

It will take loads of time, teamwork, patience, frustration, and love. 

Sound familiar?
